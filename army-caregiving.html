                    <h2>My Mission</h2>
                    <p>Serving as a soldier in a foreign country can be challenging, often leading to homesickness,
                        loneliness, and even depression. This is where my section came in. Our mission was to provide
                        soldiers with a sense of purpose and meaning, ensuring the morale within the unit remained
                        strong.</p>

                    <h2>Challenge</h2>
                    <p>One issue we encountered was that, despite having numerous opportunities to support and assist
                        soldiers, they were sometimes unaware of these resources. So I started to question:</p>
                    <p class="strong">“How can I make the care resources and events more accessible?”</p>
                </div>
                <div class="subpage-section">
                    <h2>Creating Unique Flyers</h2>
                    <p>One thing I could do best was to create attention-grabbing designs. In the Army, most flyers tend
                        to be quite similar, focusing on practicality and utility. To capture soldiers' attention, I
                        designed flyers that stood out with visually engaging elements. As a result, we were able to
                        attract a significant number of soldiers, encouraging them to learn more about the events being
                        offered.</p>

                <div class="subpage-section">
                    <h2>Creating Emergency Resources Website & Card</h2>
                    <p>One thing I captured from observation was that some soldiers were hesitant to knock on the door
                        of the caregiver likely due to introversion or uncertainty about how to ask for assistance.</p>
                    <p>To address this, I developed the emergency resources website attached the emergency resources
                        card, offering soldiers a convenient way to access help. The website also included an anonymous
                        counseling section, allowing soldiers to reach out to counseling services without disclosing
                        their identity.</p>
                    <p>I was later invited to present this model at an 8th Army Unit Ministry conference, and the
                        program was subsequently adopted as a benchmark by multiple Unit Ministry Teams within the 8th
                        Army."</p>
