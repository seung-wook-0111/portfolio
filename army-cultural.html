                    <h2>My Mission</h2>
                    <p>During my conscription, I served as a KATUSA (Korean Augmentation to the U.S. Army) soldier at a
                        U.S. Army base. My role was to bridge the soldiers of the Republic of Korea and the U.S.,
                        strengthening combined defense capabilities and symbolizing the friendship and mutual support
                        between the two nations.</p>
                    <p>My section organized various cultural exchange events to foster friendship between the two
                        nations, provide refreshment for the soldiers, and help them recognize the impact of their
                        service. My role was to manage these events from start to finish.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="subpage-section background-black">
                    <h2>Challenge</h2>
                    <p class="strong">“How can I further facilitate the cultural exchange events?”</p>
                </div>
                <div class="subpage-section">
                    <h2>Maximizing Participation</h2>
                    <p>No matter how well-planned an event is, it holds little value without participants. To maximize
                        engagement, one of my key goals was to increase participation through effective promotion. I
                        designed visually striking flyers and strategically placed them throughout unit buildings while
                        leveraging various media channels to spread the word.</p>
                    <p>As a result, participation reached an all-time high, with over 1,000 attendees across the 17
                        events I planned and managed. In recognition of this effort, I was honored with the Army
                        Commendation Medal and the Army Achievement Medal.</p>

                <div class="subpage-section">
                    <h2>Ensuring the Best Experience during the Event</h2>
                    <p>Another goal was to ensure participants had the best possible experience during the event,
                        leaving them feeling refreshed and motivated. To achieve this, I focused on enhancing event
                        quality by creating various media, including guidebooks and pamphlets, to provide clear
                        information on the event schedule, logistics, and recommended places to visit.</p>
                    <p>As a result, the events I organized received highly positive feedback, with the guidebooks and
                        designs being recognized as top three strengths in the After Action Review (AAR) and achieving
                        high satisfaction rates.</p>
