                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Ramblin’ Realm is a project designed to help international and transfer students socialize more
                        easily and enjoy activities together, while also supporting their academic life.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="subpage-section background-black">
                    <h2 class="section-emph">User Study Problem</h2>
                    <p>“What are the socializing needs and barriers faced by international and transfer
                        students?”</p>
                </div>
                <div class="subpage-section">
                    <h2>User Needs</h2>
                    <p>We conducted a survey with 26 responses—an even mix of international and transfer students. The
                        survey explored personal traits, challenges in making new friends, socializing preferences, past
                        experiences in community activities, and desired improvements.</p>
                    <p>We also ran semi-structured interviews with eight students (five international, three transfer).
                        We asked about their networking approaches, what “community” means to them, and comfortable or
                        uncomfortable social experiences.</p>
                    <p>Together, the user study revealed the following insights:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Difficulty adapting to a new environment</strong><br>Around 30% of survey
                            respondents reported challenges in making friends in a new setting. Interviews highlighted
                            that if students miss early opportunities at the start of the fall semester or arrive
                            knowing no
                            one, they struggle to integrate into existing groups.</li>
                        <li><strong>Preference for small, natural interactions</strong><br>73% of survey respondents
                            preferred small-group networking. Interviewees also emphasized wanting small, relaxed
                            activities where interactions feel natural.</li>
                        <li><strong>Need for lightweight social activities</strong><br>The biggest barrier to joining
                            group or community activities was “busy schedules,” selected by 69%—far more than any other
                            factor.</li>
                        <li><strong>Social design should support academic life</strong><br>Many interviewees noted that
                            academic support is one of the most important aspects of their social network. This suggests
                            that social features should also integrate academic collaboration.</li>
                        <li><strong>Interest-based activities are most appealing</strong><br>About 85% of respondents
                            chose shared interests or goals as key reasons for joining a group, which was also reflected
                            in interview comments.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Design Problem</h2>
                    <p>“How might we translate these insights into a solution that supports international and transfer
                        students’ socializing in a way that feels small-scale, natural, lightweight, and
                        interest-based—while still fitting smoothly into their academic lives?”</p>

                <div class="subpage-section">
                    <h2 class="section-emph">Creating the Design</h2>
                    <p>We designed an AR-based application that allows students to naturally meet others around campus
                        through lightweight AR games—individually or together—while also supporting their academic
                        tasks.</p>
                    <p>While one teammate focused on the written report and two teammates worked on lo-fi prototypes, I
                        led the hi-fi prototyping process, contributing to over 80% of the hi-fi prototype design.</p>

                <div class="subpage-section">
                    <h2>Engage</h2>
                    <p>Users can explore campus on their own AR adventure. When they encounter another user, they can
                        join a mission together—such as a lightweight social game like “Two Truths and a Lie”—allowing
                        natural, low-pressure interaction.</p>

                        suggested missions.</p>
                    <p>Users can also decorate their rooms using items purchased with coins earned from completing
                        missions or exploring campus. This turns progress into a sense of ownership and personal
                        expression.</p>

                        complete together as a mission.</p>
                    <p>For example, two students can agree on a playful “bubble tea penalty” if they don’t finish an
                        assignment. This blends socializing with academic motivation.</p>
