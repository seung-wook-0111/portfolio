                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Idea Island is based on the "Dual Pathways to Creativity Model" by <a class="intext-link"
                            href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10463281003765323" target="_blank"
                            rel="noopener">Nijstad et al. (2010)</a> which introduces
                        two pathways to achieve creativity: flexibility, which
                        considers various categories for new ideas, and persistence, which focuses deeply on a few
                        category.</p>

                    <p>Idea Island is a novel application designed to provide users with a fun and more effective
                        ideation experience. It uses LLM to classify and visually represent
                        creative ideas in a metaphorical landscape in VR. The user's ideas are mapped as
                        trees and categories generated by the LLM are visualized as islands where the trees belong.</p>
                    <p>Idea Island was designed with the intention that, as users explore these island landscapes, they
                        can think broadly, fostering cognitive flexibility. Conversely, when they focus on or navigate
                        within a specific island, they can engage in deeper thinking about that category, fostering
                        cognitive persistence.</p>

                    <h2>Status Quo Ante</h2>
                    <p>When I joined the team, the research had already progressed through user studies, and a
                        landscape-style artifact had been implemented to visualize users' ideas. However, the team
                        needed more creative input to make the artifact unique. Additionally, the existing artifact did
                        not fully meet key requirements: a clear three-level representation, visual
                        distinction of categories for balanced discussion, and a strong visual metaphor providing an
                        intuitive overview.</p>
                    <p>To address these challenges, I developed the island + tree + fruit representation, where
                        categories are divided into islands with different colors to enhance clarity and distinction. I
                        also ensured that category names and statuses remain constantly visible within the artifact for
                        better usability.</p>

                    <h2>Challenge</h2>
                    <p class="strong">“How can we further develop the artifact to better strengthen the cognitive
                        flexbility and persistence pathways?”</p>

                    <h2>Making the Landscape Explorable</h2>
                    <p>One idea I introduced was integrating the finding of <a class="intext-link"
                            href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-14435-001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oppezzo
                            and Schwartz (2014)</a> that walking while ideating
                        enhances creativity. Since we were developing a 3D VR artifact, I saw an opportunity to leverage
                        its interactivity by making the Idea Island landscape walkable and explorable.</p>
                    <p>I then developed this feature, enabling users to ideate while walking through the landscape,
                        explore the surrounding islands of different categories, and even take a cloud ride to
                        another island to discover new idea categories.</p>

                    <h2>Creating Diverse Modes for Further Research</h2>
                    <p>We identified numerous possibilities to expand this research by combining gamification techniques
                        and diverse ideas. As a result, we developed various modes to test in future research, exploring
                        how interactive 3D VR and visual metaphors can enhance users' ideation processes.</p>

                    <h2>Manual Categorization</h2>
                    <p>Manual categorization mode was created to test the effectiveness of LLM auto-categorization
                        vs. user autonomy. In this mode, the user’s ideas are represented as seedlings, and they can
                        "plant" a seedling on an island to map it to a specific category.</p>

                    <h2>Diverse Walking Modes</h2>
                    <p>We developed modes that allow users to not only walk within the island landscape but also outside
                        of it, providing a macroscopic view to enhance cognitive flexibility.</p>
                    <p>The Ring Walk Mode lets users walk along the circumference of surrounding idea islands, with
                        islands oriented inward, while the Dispersed Walk Mode allows users to walk outside the
                        circumference, with islands facing outward.</p>

                    <h2>Group Ideation Climate</h2>
                    <p>We also explored using Idea Island to promote a positive group ideation experience. Drawing on
                        the "Groupgarden" metaphorical group mirror concept from <a class="intext-link"
                            href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2639189.2639215" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tausch
                            et al. (2014)</a>, we developed
                        modes to represent the ideation climate as different weather conditions. With the LLM analyzing
                        the group dynamics, the weather improves when the climate is ideal and worsens when the
                        discussion becomes biased, overly concentrated on one person, judgmental, or similar.</p>

                    <p>The initial user experiment showed a statistically significant increase in the number of ideas by
                        1.29 (p < .01) and the number of categories by 0.88 (p < .01). The research is currently focused
                            on further refining the artifact and conducting follow-up user experiments.</p>
