                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>During our 3-week stay in Paris as part of the SNU in Paris program, our team observed how the
                        city, under the current government’s policy, had transformed into a major cycling hub. The
                        public bike-sharing service, Velib’, proved to be an affordable and convenient mode of
                        transportation, and we used it frequently. While it was a great experience, we also identified
                        areas for improvement. With Paris preparing for the Olympics and expecting a surge of
                        international visitors, we decided to undertake a project to analyze the usability of Paris's
                        public bike infrastructure from the perspective of foreigners and propose potential
                        enhancements.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="subpage-section background-black">
                    <h2>Challenge</h2>
                    <p class="strong">“How can we enhance the public bike infrastructure to create a more user-friendly
                        and convenient experience for foreigners?”</p>
                </div>
                <div class="subpage-section">
                    <h2>Quick User Study</h2>
                    <p><strong>Think Aloud</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="weak">|</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
                        foreign visitors, we used the “Think Aloud” method with our teammates as research participants.
                        Each participant documented their experience with the Velib’ system, starting from account
                        creation to reaching various targeted destinations.</p>
                    <p><strong>Observation</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="weak">|</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each
                        team member was assigned a specific location to observe riders and note any interesting aspects
                        of the infrastructure or rider behaviors.</p>
                    <p><strong>Quick Interview</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span
                            class="weak">|</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each team member also conducted interviews with two
                        riders, asking about their usage patterns and opinions on their experiences.</p>
                    <p><strong>Analysis</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="weak">|</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
                        performed thematic analysis on the qualitative data we collected to identify emerging themes and
                        areas for improvement.</p>

                    <h2>Quick Redesign of the Velib’ App and Display</h2>
                    <p>We conducted quick prototyping of an improved version of the Velib' app and display, reflecting
                        the user study analysis results.</p>
                    <img src="subpage-assets/paris-bike/app1.png" alt="">
                    <p>To address the issue of low visibility of language settings and the lack of service explanations,
                        such as the distinction between mechanical and electric bikes, the improved prototype includes
                        introductory pages with language settings and a brief overview of the service.</p>
                    <img src="subpage-assets/paris-bike/app2.png" alt="">
                    <p>To address the issue that subscription and pricing options are not easily visible or
                        comparable at a glance, and the lack of explanation about the registration process (including
                        card options and the fact that no deposit is charged at registration), the improved prototype
                        redesigns the layout to make subscription options more visible and adds necessary explanations.
                    </p>
                    <img src="subpage-assets/paris-bike/app3.png" alt="">
                    <p>To resolve the issue that tutorials are not very visible due to their wording and location,
                        the improved prototype simplifies the wording and guides users to read the tutorials after
                        registration. It also provides clear instructions on entering the access code and PIN, which
                        were major points of confusion for users. The registration page includes instructions to capture
                        the access code and PIN for future use.</p>
                    <img src="subpage-assets/paris-bike/app4.png" alt="">
                    <p>The map was enhanced with clearer fonts and larger icons, improving color contrast and size
                        for better visibility during rides. It also includes information on which side of the road the
                        bike lane is on and directions for the bicycle expressway. Additionally, riders can easily
                        switch map modes with one tap, choosing which information to display and whether to show
                        summarized or detailed data.</p>
                    <img src="subpage-assets/paris-bike/app5.png" alt="">
                    <p>The main page was redesigned for a clearer layout and a more consistent design system. The
                        availability forecast feature, previously hidden in settings, is now visible. The rent menu also
                        includes a list of available docks, helping users quickly identify empty docks for bike returns
                        without having to search through the entire list.</p>
                    <img src="subpage-assets/paris-bike/bikepad.png" alt="">
                    <p>We also suggested improving the bike rating feature, which is currently only available on the
                        app. Since Velib' bikes have their own display and keypad, we propose making the rating feature
                        accessible directly on the bike. Additionally, by incorporating LEDs with color indicators, bike
                        ratings can be more easily viewed at one glance.</p>

                <div class="subpage-section">
                    <h2>Suggestions for Infrastructure Improvements</h2>
                    <p>We visualized improvements for Place de la Bastille, one of the most confusing roundabouts, where
                        connecting bike lanes are positioned in areas that are not easily visible at first glance.</p>
                    <img src="subpage-assets/paris-bike/infra1.png" alt="">
                    <p>We recommended establishing clear color guidelines:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The road could be marked with a bicycle expressway symbol color line to indicate the
                            direction of travel.</li>
                        <li>Directional signs with the expressway symbol color, compass directions, and expressway
                            destinations should be installed.</li>
                        <li>The app should adopt the same consistent color guidelines and wording to help users easily
                            correlate the road infrastructure with the app's navigation.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <img src="subpage-assets/paris-bike/infra2.png" alt="">
                    <p>We also suggested installing bike rest areas where riders can comfortably wait at traffic lights
                        or plan their routes. These rest areas would be clearly marked with yellow color and a rest area
                        sign. The curbstone could double as a footrest for added comfort.</p>
