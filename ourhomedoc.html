                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>OurHomeDoc is a startup founded this year to <strong>connect home-visit medical professionals
                            with
                            patients</strong>, aligned
                        with the government’s initiative to formalize home-visit medical care. The service helps expand
                        access to treatment, especially for patients with limited mobility.</p>
                    <p>OurHomeDoc currently offers two products:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>A patient-facing website</strong>, where patients can request home-visit medical
                            services or receive support applying for long-term care insurance grades.</li>
                        <li><strong>A provider-facing CRM</strong> (Customer Relationship Management) platform, which
                            enables physicians to efficiently manage patients, appointments, schedules, and medical
                            documentation.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="subpage-section background-black">
                    <h2 class="section-emph">First Challenge: Patient-Facing Website</h2>
                    <p class="strong">“How can I design a patient-facing website that clearly communicates the key
                        features of the service?”</p>
                </div>
                <div class="subpage-section">
                    <h2>Landing Page Design</h2>
                    <p>The landing page is designed to be simple and straightforward. The top section features 3D
                        graphics representing the website’s two main functions—requesting home-visit medical services
                        and applying for long-term care insurance grades—along with direct call-to-action buttons for
                        each.</p>
                    <p>Below this, the page offers a clear summary of the three steps involved in making a request or
                        application, helping users understand the process at a glance and reinforcing how easy the
                        service is to use.</p>
                    <img src="subpage-assets/ourhomedoc/steps-section.png" alt="">
                </div>
                <div class="subpage-section">
                    <h2>Request / Application Page Design</h2>
                    <p>The request and application pages were designed to give users a strong sense of control by
                        clearly displaying their current progress.</p>
                    <img src="subpage-assets/ourhomedoc/request-page.png" alt="">
                    <p>On the desktop version, a progress panel on the left
                        shows both the current step and the overall process, with navigation buttons that allow users to
                        freely return to previous sections at any time. On mobile, the progress bar remains visible at
                        all times to maintain the same level of clarity.</p>
                    <img class="with-shadow" src="subpage-assets/ourhomedoc/ai-filter.png" alt="">
                    <p class="caption">The AI automatically selects filters based on the user’s symptoms. The blue
                        button allows the user to skip the filtering step easily, once the
                        suggestions are confirmed.
                    </p>
                    <p>User convenience is prioritized throughout the experience. For example, when users search for
                        medical centers to request treatment, they can simply enter their symptoms, and the AI
                        automatically chooses relevant tags for the search. This makes the selection process faster,
                        easier, and more intuitive.</p>
                    <img src="subpage-assets/ourhomedoc/steps-afterwards.png" alt="">
                    <p>Once the application for long-term care insurance grades is completed, the website clearly
                        outlines the next steps. Because this section provides important instructions on what users need
                        to do afterward, they can proceed only after confirming the information with a checkbox.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-emph">Second Challenge: CRM</h2>
                    <p class="strong">“How can we effectively assist medical professionals manage their patients,
                        schedules, and documentation?”

                </div>
                <div class="subpage-section">
                    <h2>Dashboard Page</h2>
                    <p>The dashboard highlights the most important information at a glance. It displays upcoming
                        appointments, patients waiting to be scheduled, patients with incomplete payments, and documents
                        that are recommended for completion.</p>

                <div class="subpage-section">
                    <h2>Schedule Management Page</h2>
                    <p>The schedule management page helps users find the right time slots where both the user(medical
                        professional) and the patient are available, while also accounting for travel time between
                        appointments.</p>
                    <img src="subpage-assets/ourhomedoc/crm-schedule-filter.png" alt="">
                    <p>When the user clicks on a patient entry, the patient’s available time slots are highlighted in
                        the schedule, and their location is emphasized on the map. Clicking on a specific date filters
                        the list to show only patients available on that day.</p>
                    <img src="subpage-assets/ourhomedoc/crm-schedule-cart.png" alt="">
                    <p>One of the biggest needs identified among home-visit doctors is minimizing travel time. The
                        schedule management page addresses this through an automatic optimization feature. Users can
                        drag patient entries into separate “carts,” and the system calculates the optimal visiting order
                        based on travel time between locations.</p>
                    <img src="subpage-assets/ourhomedoc/crm-schedule-drag.png" alt="">
                    <p>Once the optimization is complete, the user can simply drag the optimized blocks into the
                        calendar—and the schedule is set.</p>
                    <img src="subpage-assets/ourhomedoc/crm-schedule-monthly.png" alt="">
                    <p>Users can also switch to a monthly calendar view if they prefer a more macroscopic overview. When
                        adding a schedule, the patient’s preferred visit time and the user’s existing schedule are
                        displayed together, enabling more efficient and informed planning.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="subpage-section">
                    <h2>Patient Management Page</h2>
                    <p>The patient management page is designed to be intuitive. Selecting a patient from the table on
                        the left displays key information in the top-right panel and detailed information in the
                        bottom-right panel.</p>
                    <img src="subpage-assets/ourhomedoc/crm-default.png" alt="">
                    <p>To convey complex data within a limited table space, information is color-coded. Related
                        health policy
                        categories are shown in blue, orange, yellow, and gray. Preferred visit days & times are also
                        color-coded: morning in blue, early afternoon in yellow, and late afternoon in orange. The
                        user(medical professional)’s
                        availability is indicated with filled circles for available slots and hollow
                        circles for unavailable ones.</p>
                    <img src="subpage-assets/ourhomedoc/crm-hover.png" alt="">
                    <p>Hover interactions reveal tooltips showing details or explaining what each color represents,
                        enabling a
                        compact yet clear presentation of information.</p>
                    <img src="subpage-assets/ourhomedoc/crm-expanded.png" alt="">
                    <p>Users can flexibly adjust how much information they see. The detailed information section can
                        be
                        expanded or collapsed, allowing users to focus on either high-level summaries or more granular
                        details as needed.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="subpage-section">
                    <h2>Document Management Page</h2>
                    <p>The document management page organizes files effectively by displaying each document’s category
                        and its related healthcare policy.</p>
                    <img src="subpage-assets/ourhomedoc/crm-document.png" alt="">

                    <p>The page also prompts users to add any missing documents if none were uploaded after a
