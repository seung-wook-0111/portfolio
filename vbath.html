                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p><strong>How Much Time Did You Spend Alone Today?</strong></p>
                    <p>Probably not much—or perhaps none at all. In today’s hyper-connected world, finding solitude is
                        harder than ever. A 2017 survey by SM C&C showed that while many feel the need to stay connected
                        via social media, a growing number seek voluntary solitude, such as visiting cafés or movie
                        theaters alone.</p>
                    <p>Yet, solitude is essential for reflection and rest. A fulfilling life isn’t just about keeping
                        busy—it’s about actively shaping our own path. Despite technological advancements, this need
                        remains unchanged.</p>
                    <p>But in our fast-paced lives, such moments are rare. VBATH proposes a solution: transforming bath
                        time into meaningful solitude. One of the few moments we can truly be alone, it can be a time to
                        reset, reflect, and take control of our lives.</p>

                    <h2>Everything Prepared in Advance</h2>
                    <p>In today’s busy world, time is precious, and so is your bath time. To make the most of it, your
                        bath should be perfectly prepared in advance. Simply open the VBATH app, go to the timer
                        section, and set when you'd like to start your bath and your desired water temperature.</p>
                    <p>VBATH will automatically adjust the water level and temperature to match your preferences,
                        ensuring a perfectly prepared bath environment just in time for you to relax.</p>

                    <h2>Immersive Interaction: Connecting Water, Media Art, and Mind</h2>
                    <p>Now, step into the bathroom, where your bathtub is perfectly prepared to your desired
                        temperature. Media art videos and music await to help you enjoy your personal time in your
                        bathroom.</p>
                    <p>VBATH is not simply a concept combining media art and bathing. VBATH enhances your interaction
                        with water through immersive interactive media art. Every interaction you have with the water is
                        reflected in the media art.</p>
                    <p>Are you lost in a swirl of thoughts while bathing? Try stirring the water. The media art responds
                        to your interaction with the water. When the waves become stronger, the clear weather shifts to
                        a swirling storm, the calm waves turn rough, and the movement of objects speeds up. Through your
                        interaction with the water, focus your attention on your senses and thoughts.</p>

                    <h2>Taking Full Control through Interactive Controllers</h2>
                    <p>VPAD is your control pad that gives you full control over your bathroom experience, allowing you
                        to enjoy your time the way you want. Scroll through VPAD to choose media art that will create
                        the perfect atmosphere for relaxation, meditation, reflection, or joy.</p>
                    <p>The digital faucet dial next to VPAD operates just like an analog dial, offering a familiar,
                        intuitive experience while providing clear, accurate water temperature and level information on
                        the display. Adjust the temperature or water level by turning the dial.</p>

                    <p><br>VRING is a device that makes it easy to switch scenes. In playback mode, rub the VRING along the
                        edge of the bathtub to move the current media art forward or backward.</p>
                    <p>Double-tap VRING to change it to rainbow colors and switch to explore mode. In explore mode,
                        browse through different media art options, organized by color into similar themes.</p>
