                    <h2>Background</h2>
                    <p><strong>Is watching videos before sleep positive or negative?</strong></p>
                    <p>Sleep deprivation affects both physical and mental health, contributing to issues like obesity
                        and depression. One major cause is watching videos before bed, which can activate the brain and
                        make it difficult to sleep. With the rise of platforms like YouTube and Netflix, continuous
                        video watching has become common, further delaying sleep.</p>
                    <p>However, some studies suggest that watching videos before bed may reduce stress, potentially
                        improving sleep quality. The impact of pre-sleep video watching depends on various factors,
                        including the individual’s motives, the types of videos watched, and their effects on sleep.</p>

                    <h2>Research Question</h2>
                    <p class="strong">“How can we help people control their video-watching habits before sleep to
                        improve their sleep quality and overall well-being?”</p>

                <div class="subpage-section">
                    <h2>Study 1: Survey</h2>
                    <p>In August 2023, an online survey was conducted with 241 adults (aged 18 and over) who habitually
                        watch videos before bed. The survey aimed to explore video-watching patterns and contexts, with
                        six sections:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Daytime Video-Watching Pattern and Context</li>
                        <li>Pre-Bedtime Video-Watching Pattern and Context</li>
                        <li>Impact of Pre-Bedtime Video-Watching</li>
                        <li>Perceptions and Goals of Video-Watching</li>
                        <li>Methods for Stopping Video-Watching</li>
                        <li>Demographic Information</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3><br>The Duality of Watching Videos Before Bedtime</h3>
                    <img src="subpage-assets/sleeptube/survey1.png" alt="">
                    <p>The survey revealed an almost
                        even split in perceptions of watching videos before bed, with 119
                        people holding positive views and 122 holding negative views. This indicates both
                        potential benefits and areas for improvement. Based on these perceptions, we categorized
                        participants and conducted an in-depth analysis comparing the two groups using t-tests and
                        Chi-Square tests.</p>
                    <h3><br><br>Characteristics of the Negative Perception Group</h3>
                    <img src="subpage-assets/sleeptube/survey2.png" alt="">
                    <p>No significant differences were found between the positive and negative perception groups
                        regarding the frequency, duration, or concentration of watching videos before bedtime.</p>
                    <img src="subpage-assets/sleeptube/survey3.png" alt="">
                    <p>However, the negative perception group reported significantly poorer sleep quality and a greater
                        perceived impact of video watching on sleep and daily life. They also experienced more
                        difficulty stopping videos and believed that a shorter duration of video watching before sleep
                        was appropriate.</p>
                    <h3><br><br>What does the survey results show?</h3>
                    <p>The negative perception group reported lower sleep quality despite no significant difference in
                        viewing duration compared to the positive perception group.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>One possible explanation is that the
                            negative perception group perceived an appropriate viewing time of only 19.56 minutes,
                            significantly lower than the 60.66 minutes of the positive perception group.</li>
                        <li>Responses to open-ended questions, such as concerns about the negative effects of video
                            watching on sleep, suggest that guilt and negative emotions about video watching may
                            contribute to poorer sleep quality.</li>
                        <li>Previous research indicates that procrastination and perfectionistic tendencies lead to
                            guilt and negative emotions, which can hinder sleep.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This suggests <strong>a cycle where negative emotions about video watching worsen sleep
                            quality</strong>.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="subpage-section">
                    <h2>Study 2: Interview</h2>
                    <p>To better understand pre-sleep video consumption, we conducted semi-structured interviews with
                        eight individuals (university students and working professionals in their twenties) who had a
                        negative perception of watching videos before bed.</p>
                    <h3><br>Key Insights from the Interviews</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Importance of Video Watching Before Bed</strong><br>Participants valued this time as
                            a quiet,
                            personal period for focused video consumption, suggesting that Digital Self-Control Tools
                            (DSCT) should support this experience.</li>
                        <li><strong>Video Watching as a Low-Energy Hobby</strong><br>Watching videos was considered an
                            easy,
                            low-energy hobby, making it hard to replace with other activities. Only reducing screen time
                            might not be the best solution.</li>
                        <li><strong>Need for Better Video Selection</strong><br>
                            Participants often struggled to find enjoyable content,
                            with some suggesting pre-selecting videos before bed to improve the experience.</li>
                        <li><strong>Emotional Support for Video Watching</strong><br>Negative perceptions around
                            watching videos
                            before bed affected enjoyment and sleep quality. A more positive approach to video watching
                            could improve sleep.</li>
                        <li><strong>Personalized Tools</strong><br>Participants’ habits varied depending on their
                            schedule, indicating a need for tools that adapt to individual situations.</li>
                        <li><strong>Shielding from Endless Recommendations</strong><br>Many participants struggled with
                            the temptation
                            of endless video suggestions. A system to limit recommendations could help reduce excessive
                            viewing.</li>

                    <h2>Designing SleepTube</h2>
                    <p>Based on survey and interview findings, we identified the need for a digital self-control tool
                        for managing video watching before bed. We designed a prototype for YouTube to address these
                        needs.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Better Viewing Satisfaction</strong><br>A “shopping cart” feature lets
                            users add videos throughout the day and watch them within a set time limit before bed,
                            improving viewing satisfaction.</li>
                        <li><strong>Emotional Support</strong><br>After watching all selected videos, the app character
                            offers positive reinforcement like “Well done! You’ll be able to sleep well now!” to help
                            users transition to sleep.</li>
                        <li><strong>Flexible Goal Setting</strong><br>
                            Users can set daily viewing limits based on their energy levels and schedule, with the app
                            adjusting based on responses like tiredness or upcoming tasks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Blocking Excessive Recommendations</strong><br>To prevent over-watching, we
                            separated the search and recommendation functions, allowing users to watch only pre-selected
                            videos from their playlist.</li>
