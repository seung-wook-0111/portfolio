                    <h2>Background</h2>
                    <p>The Seoul Metropolitan Subway is one of the world’s largest and most complex metro systems, with
                        over 300 stations and an annual ridership exceeding 2 billion, thanks to its affordability and
                        convenience.</p>
                    <p>However, despite its vital role as an accessible public transportation system, the Seoul
                        Metropolitan Subway has faced persistent criticism for its information design. The lack of a
                        unified design system and the top-down nature of the bureaucratic design process have left many
                        users—especially newcomers to the giant metropolis, travelers, foreign residents, and
                        individuals with disabilities—struggling to navigate the complex network, despite multiple
                        efforts to improve the design system.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-emph">User Study Problem</h2>
                    <p>With these challenges in mind, we launched the Seoul Subway Information System Redesign project.
                        To identify users’ needs in detail, we formulated the following research question:</p>
                    <p class="strong">“What specific information and design elements do users need to successfully
                        navigate the subway system?”</p>

                <div class="subpage-section">
                    <h2>Qualitative User Study</h2>
                    <p>We recruited 11 participants from various age groups, including four foreigners and three
                        visually impaired individuals, and conducted qualitative user research.</p>
                    <p>First, we conducted a <strong>Think-Aloud + Observation</strong> session. Participants were asked
                        to complete two
                        subway journeys: one without using a smartphone—simulating scenarios where network access or
                        battery is unavailable—and another using smartphone apps as they normally would. We accompanied
                        participants throughout their journey, from locating the entrance and using apps and signage to
                        plan their route, to navigating inside the station, boarding the subway, and reaching their
                        destination. During the process, participants were instructed to verbalize which information
                        design elements they referenced and how they made their navigation decisions.</p>
                    <p>Following the first session, we conducted <strong>semi-structured interviews</strong>.
                        Participants were presented with
                        various styles of information design available in Seoul Subway, such as signs and displays, and
                        asked to rate them. The goal was to encourage participants to articulate their thoughts, discuss
                        the strengths and weaknesses of the design to identify the elements most important to their
                        subway navigation and riding experience.</p>

                    <h2>Analysis & Design Framework</h2>
                    <p>Afterward, four team members conducted a qualitative analysis of all the collected data, which
                        included open, axial, and selective coding.</p>
                    <p>As a result, we developed a design framework that reflects users’ experiences and opinions,
                        highlighting key elements that remain prominent across different information design mediums and
                        demographic groups.</p>

                    <h2>Target Issue</h2>
                    <p><strong>Sense of Stability and Control</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="weak">|</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TTOKTTOK addresses the issue that limited physical space for information in subway trains and
                        stations prevents users from seeing the “big picture” of their journey, which is essential for a
                        sense of stability and comfort.</p>
                    <p><strong>Conveying Core Information</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="weak">|</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, current information design fails to effectively communicate “core information” to marginalized groups, such
                        as non-Korean speakers and visually impaired individuals, leaving them uncertain and uneasy.</p>
                    <p><strong>Appropriate Placement</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="weak">|</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While smartphones offer a good alternative to overcome the limitations of physical space,
                        existing subway map apps are ineffective at providing core and helpful information. Users must
                        navigate through multiple steps to retrieve the information they need, which causes delays and
                        confusion.</p>

                <div class="subpage-section">
                    <h2>Designing the Solution</h2>
                    <p>We developed TTOKTTOK by directly applying the design framework, displaying “core
                        information” with temporal and spatial continuity, while presenting “helpful information”
                        concisely.</p>
                    <img src="subpage-assets/ttokttok/example1.png" alt="">
                    <p>TTOKTTOK provides relevant information for each step of the subway journey by detecting the
                        user’s location and situation via GPS and beacons. Drawing from user research data, it
                        <strong>consistently displays the “core information” at the top</strong> of the screen, with <strong>“helpful
                        information” below, presented in customizable modules</strong>. These modules adapt to the user’s travel
                        patterns, pace, and preferences, learning intelligently over time.</p>
                    <p>TTOKTTOK is <strong>especially beneficial for the visually impaired</strong>, offering a consistent and
                        predictable modular interface that is compatible with VoiceOver. It aims to provide users with a
                        clear overview of their journey, offering greater freedom and ease for those whose travels are
                        often limited by routes they can remember.</p>
